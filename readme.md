# Compression Algorithms
The purpose of this project is to learn the common compression algorithms currently in use 
in the real world and from this knowledge potentially make a new compression algorithm 
for my specific use case.
## Project structure
This project has been structured such that each branch contains the each of the compression
algorithms.
